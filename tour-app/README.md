## The process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Mobile Responsiveness

### What we learned

We learnt how to build UI with React and update the state using React useState Hook with React `useEffect` to fetch data from our given API url. And also how to implement the loading state when the data called from the API isn't ready yet.

### Continued development

We want to focus more on State management, API using the React `useEffect` Hook and debugging.

### Useful resources

- [useState Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html) - This helped with the syntax and how to apply it to a function.
- [useEffect Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html) - This helped or enabled us to get data from an external server (API) in order to display content to our users.

## Where to find everything

The components are in the src folder `src`.
You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

## Building your project

1. Initialize your project
```
npx create-react-app appName
cd appName
npm start
```
2. Edit the files you want to and it updates on the localhost.

## Deploying your project
